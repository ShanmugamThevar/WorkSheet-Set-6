We choose a statistical test and statistics used to reject null hypothesis and a critical region for the statistics to lie in that is extreme for the null hypothesis to be rejected/p-value. We calculate the test statistics frrom the data and check the critical region by common tests like Z test, T-test, chi-squared test, Anova and F-test."

It’s best to use the mean when the distribution of the data values is symmetrical and there are no clear outliers. It’s best to use the median when the the distribution of data values is skewed or when there are clear outliers. The median also does a better job of capturing the central location of a distribution when there are outliers present in the data."
